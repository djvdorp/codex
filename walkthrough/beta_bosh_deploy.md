Now that that's handled, let's deploy for real:

```

Deployed '(( insert_property site.name ))-staging-bosh' to '(( insert_property site.name ))-proto-bosh'
```

This will take a little less time than **proto-BOSH** did (some packages were already compiled), and the next time you deploy, it go by much quicker, as all the packages should have been compiled by now (unless upgrading BOSH or the stemcell).

Once the deployment finishes, target the new BOSH Director to verify it works:

```
$ safe get secret/(( insert_property site.name ))/staging/bosh/users/admin # grab the admin user's password for bosh
$ bosh target https://10.4.32.4:25555 (( insert_property site.name ))-staging
Target set to '(( insert_property site.name ))-staging-bosh'
Your username: admin
Enter password:
Logged in as 'admin'
```

Again, since our creds are already in the long-term vault, we can skip the credential migration that was done in the proto-bosh deployment and go straight to committing our new deployment to the repo, and pushing it upstream.

Now it's time to move on to deploying our `beta` (staging) Cloud Foundry!
