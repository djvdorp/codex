That should be it, finally. Let's deploy!

Deployed '(( insert_property site.name ))-staging-cf' to '(( insert_property site.name ))-staging-bosh'

```

If you want to scale your deployment in the current environment (here it is staging), you can modify `scaling.yml` in your `cf-deployments/(( insert_property site.name ))/staging` directory. In the following example, you scale runners in both AZ to 2. Afterwards you can run `make manifest` and `make deploy`, please always remember to verify your changes in the manifest before you type `yes` to deploy making sure the changes are what you want.

```
jobs:

- name: runner_z1
  instances: 2

- name: runner_z2
  instances: 2

```

After a long while of compiling and deploying VMs, your CF should now be up, and accessible! You can
check the sanity of the deployment via `genesis bosh run errand smoke_tests`. Target it using
`cf login -a https://api.system.<your CF domain>`. The admin user's password can be retrieved
from Vault. If you run into any trouble, make sure that your DNS is pointing properly to the
correct ELB for this environment, and that the ELB has the correct SSL certificate for your site.
