#### Beta Cloud Foundry

To deploy Cloud Foundry, we will go back into our `ops` directory, making use of
the `cf-deployments` repo created when we built our alpha site:

```
$ cd ~/ops/cf-deployments
```

Also, make sure that you're targeting the right Vault, for good measure:

```
$ safe target proto
```

We will now create an `(( insert_property site.name ))` site for CF:

```
$ genesis new site --template (( insert_property template_name )) (( insert_property site.name ))
Created site (( insert_property site.name )) (from template (( insert_property template_name ))):
~/ops/cf-deployments/(( insert_property site.name ))

```

And the `staging` environment inside it:

```
$ genesis new env (( insert_property site.name )) staging
RSA 1024 bit CA certificates are loaded due to old openssl compatibility
