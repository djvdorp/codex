Bolo is a monitoring system that collects metrics and state data
from your BOSH deployments, aggregates it, and provides data
visualization and notification primitives.

### Deploying Bolo Monitoring

You may opt to deploy Bolo once for all of your environments, in
which case it belongs in your management network, or you may
decide to deploy per-environment Bolo installations.  What you
choose mostly only affects your network topology / configuration.

To get started, you're going to need to create a Genesis
deployments repo for your Bolo deployments:

```
$ cd ~/ops
$ genesis new deployment --template bolo
$ cd bolo-deployments
```

Next, we'll create a site for your datacenter or VPC.  The bolo
template deployment offers some site templates to make getting
things stood up quick and easy, including:

- `(( insert_property template_name ))` for Amazon Web Services VPC deployments
- `vsphere` for VMWare ESXi virtualization clusters
- `bosh-lite` for deploying and testing locally

```
$ genesis new site --template (( insert_property template_name )) (( insert_property site.name ))
Created site (( insert_property site.name )) (from template (( insert_property template_name ))):
~/ops/bolo-deployments/(( insert_property site.name ))

    ├── resource-pools.yml
    ├── stemcell
    │   ├── name
    │   └── version
    └── update.yml

2 directories, 10 files
```

Now, we can create our environment.

```
$ cd ~/ops/bolo-deployments/(( insert_property site.name ))
$ genesis new env (( insert_property site.name )) proto
Created environment (( insert_property site.name ))/proto:
~/ops/bolo-deployments/(( insert_property site.name ))/proto

├── credentials.yml
├── director.yml
├── monitoring.yml
├── name.yml
├── networking.yml
├── properties.yml
└── scaling.yml

0 directories, 10 files
```

Bolo deployments have no secrets, so there isn't much in the way
of environment hooks for setting up credentials.
