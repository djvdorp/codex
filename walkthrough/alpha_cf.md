#### Alpha Cloud Foundry

To deploy CF to our alpha environment, we will need to first ensure we're targeting the right
Vault/BOSH:

```
$ cd ~/ops
$ safe target proto

(*) proto	https://10.4.1.16:8200

$ bosh target alpha
Target set to `(( insert_property site.name ))-alpha-bosh-lite'
```

Now we'll create our deployment repo for cloudfoundry:

```
$ genesis new deployment --template cf
cloning from template https://github.com/starkandwayne/cf-deployment
Cloning into '~/ops/cf-deployments'...

Embedding genesis script into repository
genesis v1.5.2 (ec9c868f8e62)

 2 files changed, 3666 insertions(+), 150 deletions(-)
 rewrite README.md (99%)
 create mode 100755 bin/genesis
```

And generate our bosh-lite based alpha environment:

```
$ cd cf-deployments
$ genesis new site --template bosh-lite bosh-lite
Created site bosh-lite (from template bosh-lite):

Unlike all the other deployments so far, we won't use `make manifest` to vet the manifest for CF. This is because the bosh-lite CF comes out of the box ready to deploy to a Vagrant-based bosh-lite with no tweaks.  Since we are using it as the Cloud Foundry for our alpha environment, we will need to customize the Cloud Foundry base domain, with a domain resolving to the IP of our `alpha` bosh-lite VM:

```
cd bosh-lite/alpha
$ cat properties.yml
---
meta:
  cf:
    base_domain: 10.4.1.80.sslip.io
```

Now we can deploy:

```
$ make deploy
