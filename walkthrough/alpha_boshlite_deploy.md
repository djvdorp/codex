And finally, we can deploy again:

```
$ make deploy

Deployed `(( insert_property site.name ))-alpha-bosh-lite' to `(( insert_property site.name ))-proto-bosh'
```

Now we can verify the deployment and set up our `bosh` CLI target:

```
# grab the admin password for the bosh-lite
$ safe get secret/(( insert_property site.name ))/alpha/bosh-lite/users/admin
--- # secret/(( insert_property site.name ))/alpha/bosh-lite/users/admin
password: YOUR-PASSWORD-WILL-BE-HERE


$ bosh target https://10.4.1.80:25555 alpha
Target set to `(( insert_property site.name ))-alpha-bosh-lite'

Enter password:

$ bosh status

Tadaaa! Time to commit all the changes to deployment repo, and push to where we're storing
them long-term.
